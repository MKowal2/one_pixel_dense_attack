# One pixel attack for dense prediction tasks

In this repository, I experiement with the characteristic found in the paper [One pixel attack for fooling deep neural networks
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08864). 

I apply a similar attack to experiment with how many pixels are required to significantly reduce the accuracy for a deeplabv2 semantic segmentation network.

It takes more than 1 pixel to reduce the accuracy more than 0.01%, but with 6+ pixels, the accuracy can drop on a single image by a percent.
